## Apple is the "World's Most Admired Company" for the 17th consecutive year!

Apple is not only the world's largest company by market capitalisation, but also the world's "Most Admired Company".

According to Fortune magazine, Apple has been ranked as the world's most admired company again in 2023, the 17th consecutive year that the company has received this honour.

Fortune publishes the list annually based on ratings from executives, directors and analysts across a wide range of industries. The ratings are based on criteria such as investment value, management quality, and social responsibility.

Apple Inc. topped the list in social responsibility, financial soundness, innovation and global competitiveness, with a total score of 8.19, which is slightly lower than last year's score of 8.65 but still well ahead of the rest of the pack. Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. ranked second and third, with scores of 7.93 and 7.88, respectively.

According to the rules published by Fortune, the list of 1,500 candidates was first shortlisted to include 1,000 of the largest U.S. companies and 500 non-U.S. companies with a market capitalisation of more than $10 billion.

Apple has been able to maintain its leading position for a long time, mainly due to its excellent products and services, as well as its relentless pursuit of innovation and social responsibility.

For example, this year, Apple has not only launched highly popular devices such as the iPhone 15 and Vision Pro headset. It also made positive contributions in areas such as environmental protection, protection of user privacy, and education. Apple's CEO Tim Cook said that their goal is to "create the best products to bring a better future for people and the planet."

Apple was also ranked first in the computer industry, followed by Asustek Computer, Lenovo and Wistron, according to the report. In the ranking of the internet services and retail industry, Apple was ranked fourth behind Amazon, Alphabet and Alibaba.

Fortune's list, which has been published for 25 years, is said to reflect the companies' corporate reputation and industry standing. Apple's ability to win the title for 17 consecutive years is undoubtedly a testament to its excellence and influence in the global business arena.
