In many unboxing and test video, see the most "kidney" pain may be the Vision Pro drop test, which is probably the Vision Pro first broken ~ ~.

According to AppleTrack, the Vision Pro headset (especially the glass surface) performed much stronger than expected in the drop test.

AppleTrack simulated several environments to test the wear and tear of the Vision Pro, for example, when the user wearing the Vision Pro walking around the house accidentally hit a wall or cabinet, the front glass of the Vision Pro will only have a few scratches, but will not cause serious damage.

## Vision Pro drop test

The results of multiple tests say that when users are wearing the Vision Pro headset, it can easily withstand a collision of normal strength and it's hard to cause the front glass to shatter, at least not until you get a concussion.

During the test, while the camera, glass, and lenses were fine, the speaker on the right side stopped working. It's possible that the connection on the side of the headband was disconnected internally, preventing the audio module from receiving power.

The Vision Pro also performed very well in the drop from the head test, resisting several drops onto the carpet. On the eighth drop test from a very high place, the Vision Pro's glass finally cracked on the ground test.

Interestingly, the Vision Pro glass can be peeled off in one piece when broken, kind of like the front windscreen of a car. And even after the glass shattered, most of the Vision Pro's features worked as normal, including the interior and exterior EyeSight screens inside that were up and running.
