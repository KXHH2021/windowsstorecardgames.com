## Apple's Greater China revenue fell 13 per cent with iPhone sales leading the way!

Due to the global economic level decline, the smartphone industry is also quite affected, the major brands of mobile phone sales have declined to varying degrees, even Apple is no exception.

Recently, Apple announced the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 financial data, the quarter in Greater China revenue of $ 20.8 billion (about 149.604 billion yuan), the same period last year revenue of $ 23.9 billion, a year-on-year decline of 13 per cent.

This "report card" is hardly satisfactory, but in the overall context of Apple's products, it is almost impossible to avoid a decline in sales.


## Apple CEO Tim Cook believes

Apple CEO Tim Cook believes that the decline in revenue in Greater China is not caused by the loss of popularity of the iPhone, but rather by the overall economic downturn, which is the primary factor causing the problem.

Compared to previous years, Apple's overall sales are on the decline, but compared to other brands, the current iPhone still has a dominant position in the smartphone market.

Previously, market research agency Counterpoint Research released data, in the fourth quarter of 2023, China's mobile phone sales, iPhone ahead of other mobile phone brands, although Apple's overall shipments fell 9%, but still with 20.2% of the market share, ranked first.

ImageNot only that, in Q4 2023, Apple's mobile phones took up four of the top six spots in China's smartphone sales, which is enough to show the iPhone's prominent position in the smartphone market.

Of course, blind self-confidence is not a good thing, and it is better to think of danger in peace in order to develop in the longer term. Nowadays, all the major Android brands are developing rapidly, and national brands are also rising rapidly, closely following Apple.

Although Apple is still able to lead the smartphone market with its unique ecosystem and excellent products, the iPhone's primacy is likely to be shaken by the entry of more Android brands that are "way ahead of the curve".

Now the smartphone market has entered a bottleneck, in terms of hardware, the iPhone is difficult to get leapfrog upgrade, good news that Apple is accelerating the AI research and development process, effective hardware and software enhancement may be able to effectively boost iPhone sales, and further solidify Apple's premier position.
