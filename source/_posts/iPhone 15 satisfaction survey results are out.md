## iPhone 15 satisfaction survey results are out!

Apple launched the first iPhone in 2007, creating a success story that is almost impossible to replicate. At that time, Apple's creation and innovation is undoubtedly ahead of its time, but now, the smartphone industry has been the development stage of the "bottleneck", the gap between the iPhone iteration is also getting smaller and smaller ...

Whether a product is successful or not can be seen from the user feedback. PerfectRec, a market research organisation, collected over 700,000 user reviews via Google to find out how satisfied the latest iPhone 15 series is in the market.

With the support of data, users' evaluation and satisfaction level of the 4 models of iPhone 15 series can be shown, and we can also learn the strengths and weaknesses of iPhone 15 series from the feedback of real users.

Overall, the overall satisfaction of the iPhone 15Pro series has been on a downward trend since its launch in September 2023, while the satisfaction of the two standard models, the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15Plus, is slowly increasing.

The report shows that after Apple launched the iPhone 15 series in September 2024, the iPhone 15Pro had a 73.5 per cent five-star rating and the iPhone 15ProMax had a 77 per cent five-star rating. As of January 2024, the former's positive rating dropped to 66.1 per cent and the latter to 72.5 per cent.

Over the same time span, iPhone 15 satisfaction rose from 68.2 per cent to 78.1 per cent and iPhone 15Plus from 70 per cent to 73.5 per cent, showing that the standard model of iPhone is becoming increasingly popular with consumers.

### Why iPhone 15 series satisfaction is declining.

Out of the 700,000+ user reviews, there are 3 main reasons that highlight why the iPhone 15 series is declining in satisfaction.

Firstly, the battery life of the iPhone 15Pro series fails to meet the needs of users, which is certainly a major pain point for modern people who are not always on the go.

Secondly, the gap between the aforementioned iPhone iterations is getting smaller and smaller, and the iPhone 15 series doesn't seem to bring any eye-catching innovations or enhancements compared to its predecessor.

The third reason has to do with the design of the iPhone 15's body, and even some reviews are extremely unhappy with its protruding camera camera - after all, the large and heavy camera module may affect the user experience to some extent.
