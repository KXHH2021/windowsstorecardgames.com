## iPad mini series may be replaced by foldable devices!

According to Korean media outlet The Elec, Apple is considering launching a 7- to 8-inch foldable device between 2026 and 2027, which could replace the current 8.3-inch iPad mini6.

However, there are also reports that Apple is also actively working on an iPad mini with an OLED screen, so there is uncertainty about the nature and specifications of Apple's foldable device. There are also different speculations in the industry that the foldable device could be a foldable iPhone or iPad.

As early as last year, Samsung Display and LG Display have started sending samples of 7-inch and 8-inch foldable panels to Apple.

Among the panel companies, Samsung Display has been more active than LG Display in developing Apple's foldable panels, and if Apple decides to release a foldable device in 2026, Samsung Display is likely to be the main panel supplier.

Apple, Samsung Display and LG Display also have different views on the ultra-thin glass material, the foldable panel overlay window and the hinge concept, a core part of the product mechanism.

Do you think Apple will launch a folding screen iPad or iPhone first?
