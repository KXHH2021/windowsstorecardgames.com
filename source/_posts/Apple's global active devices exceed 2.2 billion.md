The earnings report showed that Apple had revenues of about $119.56 billion for the last three months, with quarterly net income of $33.9 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.18. This compares to revenue of $117.2bn and quarterly net income of $30bn, or $1.88 diluted EPS, in the same period last year.

In addition to the stock gains, iPhone revenue was $6.97 billion, iPad revenue was $702 million, Mac revenue was $778 million, wearables, home and accessories revenue was $1.195 billion and subscription services revenue was $2.312 billion.

Tim Cook said, "Apple reported revenue growth in the December quarter, driven by iPhone sales and record revenues in Services. We are pleased to announce that our active device install base has now surpassed 2.2 billion units, a record high across all product and geographic segments."

Apple last shared its global active devices in January 2023, when the company had 2 billion active devices worldwide. While Apple didn't provide detailed device numbers, iPhone users have long had more than 1 billion active devices worldwide.

Asked about the possible economic consequences of changes to the EU App Store. Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said the EU only accounts for 7 per cent of Apple's global App Store revenue. Cook, on the other hand, said that it is impossible to determine this impact as Apple finds it difficult to predict what customers and developers will choose.

Additionally, Cook mentioned the progress of Apple's research in artificial intelligence. Cook said, "Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. This includes artificial intelligence, where we will continue to invest a lot of time and effort, and are excited to share details of our ongoing work in this area later this year."
