## iPhone 16 design is suspected to be exposed!

Unconsciously the Year of the Dragon is approaching, the Chinese New Year Festival has not yet arrived iPhone 16 but ushered in a new revelation.

Recently, the social platform X (former Twitter) out of the "suspected iPhone 16 mobile phone" design drawings, and then foreign media theapplehub as the basis for the production of a more vivid mobile phone rendering.

The image clearly shows the design of the iPhone 16, including the rear camera arrangement that Apple has adjusted for it, which is the most conspicuous.

If the revelations are true, the iPhone 16's rear camera will feature a vertical dual camera design. Apple has used this camera arrangement since the iPhone X, and only abandoned this design with the arrival of the iPhone 13.

They say that trends go in a circle, and now the iPhone 16 rear camera look is expected to go back in time. Of course, it's not just for aesthetics - the vertically arranged rear camera is more conducive to shooting spatial video for use with Apple's new Vision Pro headset.

On top of that, the new photo button on the iPhone 16 can also be found in the image. Designed just to the side of the power button, the button seems to be the same size as the power button, with a more symmetrical aesthetic, and such a simple design can also greatly enhance the user's shooting experience.

The new "Photo" button on the iPhone 16 series is understood to be mechanical rather than solid, so it actually moves when pressed. It also responds to touch and pressure, allowing users to "swipe left and right to zoom in and out, tap the button to focus, and press hard to start recording."

The new photo button will be a major selling point for the iPhone 16, as it's easily accessible when the device is held horizontally in the user's hand, and the more comfortable holding position allows for a more stable shooting process, which will help the user make better films.

In addition to the above, it has also been revealed that the iPhone 16 may be upgraded with 8GB of RAM across the board, and that the two standard models will also have higher multitasking capabilities. Of course, in order to be able to differentiate from the high-end models, the iPhone 16Pro series may get more enhancements.

Multiple sources indicate that the display size of the iPhone 16Pro/ProMax will be increased to 6.3/6.9 inches, so that the body space can also be improved, and new hardware enhancements will come along with it, including the periscope telephoto lens.
